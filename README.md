***Notes Regarding the Fork***

This project is forked from very nice layout project: https://github.com/eluleci/FlatUI

As is mentioned in this post:
https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

*"After using GitHub by yourself for a while, you may find yourself wanting to contribute to someone else’s project. Or maybe you’d like to use someone’s project as the starting point for your own. This process is known as forking."*

It is the latter in the case of this project.  


Project Scope
-------------

Requirements:
- Get user input for basic info
- Persist to remote service, eg Firebase


Enhancements beyond requirements:
- Leveraging the FlatUI project for a clean default UI/UX template to start with
- Support for data binding on the input form
